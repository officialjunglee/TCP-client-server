Client Server and Mirror interface with indigenious Unix CLI.

I have developed this project out of interest to establish TCP communication using socket programming using C.

Used socket library to transfer files allowing the client to download files from the server.

Clients can make requests to the Mirror if the server is busy thereby balancing the server load.

To run, simply run the server, client and mirror(optional) files in any Unix enviorment or BSD.

Helps me understand how distributed systems work.
